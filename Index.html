                         <p class="text">As Jesus walked by, He saw a man blind from birth. 
                His disciples asked whose sin caused it—his or his 
                parents’. Jesus replied that neither had sinned; the
                man’s condition was an opportunity to show God’s power.
                Jesus made mud with His saliva, placed it on the man’s 
                eyes, and told him to wash in the Pool of Siloam. The man
                obeyed—and came back seeing. This miracle stirred confusion 
                and controversy. Neighbors were shocked, and the Pharisees were 
                outraged it happened on the Sabbath. They interrogated the man and 
                his parents, trying to discredit the healing. But the man stood firm,
                famously saying, “One thing I do know: I was blind, but now I see.”
                Eventually, he was cast out of the synagogue. Jesus found him again,
                revealed Himself as the Son of Man, and the man believed. Jesus then 
                taught that spiritual blindness—refusing to see the truth—is worse than 
                physical blindness.</p>
